# VoteSecure Lite 🗳️

**VoteSecure Lite** is a robust, secure online voting system simulation built with **Python** and **Flask**. Designed for educational and demonstration purposes, it showcases how to implement complex security features—such as **OTP Multi-Factor Authentication** and **strict password validation**—without incurring external costs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The core mission of VoteSecure Lite is to demonstrate a fair digital ballot handling system. It ensures that every transaction is atomic and verifiable. The latest version introduces advanced authentication workflows that mimic enterprise-grade systems:

-   **Mock Email Inbox (Zero-Cost Testing)**: To simulate real-world email OTPs without paid SMTP servers or complex API keys, the system includes a built-in "Virtual Inbox". This allows developers and testers to see the OTP emails generated by the system instantly within the application itself.
-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (OTP)**: Users must verify their email address via a One-Time Password (OTP) before their account is activated.
-   **Enhanced Password Security**: The system enforces strict password complexity rules (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) using Regex validation to prevent weak credentials.
-   **Secure Voting Transaction**: Ensures adherence to the "One Person, One Vote" principle using database locking mechanisms and atomic commits.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies & Features

-   **Backend**: Python, Flask, Flask-Login
-   **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
-   **Security**: Werkzeug Security Hashing, Regex Validation, OTP Logic
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Jinja2 Templating

## 🏁 How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Start the Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  **Experience the Flow**:
    -   Register a new user (observe the password rules).
    -   When asked for OTP, click **"Open Mock Inbox"** to retrieve your code.
    -   Cast your vote and view real-time results!

This project serves as a comprehensive example of full-stack Python web development, emphasizing security, user experience, and cost-effective testing strategies.
